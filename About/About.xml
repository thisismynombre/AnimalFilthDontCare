I only updated the Supported Version. I'm happy to delete this once the original author updates the mod.
	
Your grizzly bear is hauling a stack of neutroamine to your drug lab? Animal filth. Your megasloth is poking around the freezer for a snack? Animal filth. Donkey loose in the hospital? Animal filth.

But... you don't care. Against all odds, you have a few colonists who are not incapable of cleaning. And it's not like you're going to lay down straw matting everywhere your hauling animals might step.

This mod removes the warning. That's it.
